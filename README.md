Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset involves a comprehensive examination of the data to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions through statistical summaries and graphical representations. The Titanic dataset, famous for its historical significance and use in data science education, includes information about passengers on the ill-fated ship.
Data Overview
The dataset typically includes variables such as:
PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger
Survived: Survival indicator (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Name of the passenger
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Ticket fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Initial Analysis
The initial step in EDA involves summarizing the data:
Descriptive Statistics: Mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation for numerical variables.
Missing Values: Identification of missing data points and deciding on strategies for imputation or removal.
Data Types: Ensuring correct data types for each feature.
Univariate Analysis
This analysis focuses on single variables:
Survival Rates: Calculating the overall survival rate and visualizing it using bar charts.
Age Distribution: Analyzing age distribution with histograms and box plots.
Fare Distribution: Assessing fare variations using histograms.
Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis
Examining relationships between two or more variables:
Survival by Class: Analyzing survival rates across different passenger classes using grouped bar charts.
Gender and Survival: Evaluating the impact of gender on survival rates through cross-tabulation and bar charts.
Age and Survival: Investigating how age affected survival rates using scatter plots and box plots.
Visualizations
EDA heavily relies on visual tools:
Heatmaps: To identify correlations between variables.
Pair Plots: To examine relationships between multiple numerical features.
Insights
Key insights often include:
Higher survival rates for women and children.
Lower-class passengers had lower survival rates.
The embarkation point might correlate with survival chances.
